    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>
        I started learning programming just after my Advance Level Examinations. 
        The first language that I started learning was Python.I started learning them through online resources.
        My first program that I had run was a simple "Hello World" program but after looking at the result I was very happy.
        I still remember how overjoyed I was. Then I started continuing learning more and more.

        This hobby of mine helped me in taking a decision about my future. After I had completed my A/L's examination I had  
        no idea on what I'm going to do in the future. It is the starting of learning programming languages made me realize 
        that I should do something that will open oportunities for me to join the IT industry which is one of the growing industries 
        and also an industry that I had been loving to join.        
    </p>

        Learning programming languages helps you in many ways. Firstly, it helps you to increase your problem solving skills. Moreover it will help 
        you to become financially stable. For some this could be a stress but if you love it it's not a stress. It also helps you 
        to connect yourself with other people around the world by sharing your work.
